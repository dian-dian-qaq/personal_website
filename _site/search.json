    "text": "Debt delinquency can have drastic effects on the well being of an individual, leading to consequences such as credit score reduction, foreclosure, repossession, account closure, lawsuits, physical health detriments, and even higher crime rates. Thus, we will explore the relationships between debt delinquency rate and factors such as parental income group to better understand the root causes and underlying patterns that lead to higher delinquency rates among the United States population. In this study, we examine how debt delinquency rates vary within socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, with particular attention to childhood family income.\nThrough identifying underlying patterns and potential structural dividers of debt delinquency, this study aims to provide insights that may inform policymakers, financial institutions and community organizations. Ultimately, this study hopes that these findings will support the development of more equitable credit practices and interventions that enhance both the financial stability and overall well-being of individuals.\nThis study is a statistics 140XP final project."

This project focuses on travel mobility within California, analyzing county-level data to understand how political and psychological influences shaped changes in travel distance and frequency throughout the pandemic.\nBy analyzing mobility patterns across California counties during the COVID-19 pandemic, this project sheds light on how people responded to external pressures, such as political messaging, public health mandates, and psychological stress. These insights can help policymakers, public health officials, and researchers better understand and respond to human behavior during future crises.\nThis project is a website created for Digital Humanities 101.\n\n\n\nWebsite Image\n\n\nVisit the website→"
